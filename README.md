# Dream Big - Saar Branch Attendance and Scoring System Proposal

## Objective
The objective of this proposal is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the student attendance and scoring process for our team by implementing a digital solution.

## Situation
The current student attendance and scoring process for Saar Branch team is inefficient and inaccurate. It involves manually recording student names and scores on a board or notes, which is then transferred to a spreadsheet. This process consumes a lot of time and causes delays between classes. Moreover, it leads to errors and inconsistencies, especially when many students have the same name. These challenges affect the quality and reliability of our data and hinder our ability to monitor and evaluate our studentsâ€™ progress and performance. Therefore, we need a digital solution that can streamline the data collection process and enhance accuracy.

## Proposed Solution
I recommend the implementation of a mobile-friendly, user-friendly digital solution that allows Dream Big Saar Branch volunteers to input attendance and scores directly into a centralized system. The proposed solution should have the following features:

1. **Mobile Accessibility:** Volunteers should be able to use their smartphones to input attendance and scores.

2. **Limited Access:** The system should allow for controlled access, permitting volunteers to input data for a designated period only. After this period, access should be automatically revoked.

3. **Ease of Use:** The solution should be intuitive and require minimal training for volunteers to ensure quick adoption.

4. **Students are not assigned to one volunteer only.**

## Technical Solution
The proposed technical solution involves leveraging Google Sheets and Google Scripts to create a streamlined attendance and scoring system. This solution will provide a user-friendly interface accessible on mobile devices, ensuring efficient and accurate data collection.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Google Sheets Setup:** Create a dedicated Google Sheet for attendance and scoring data.
2. **Google Scripts:** Develop scripts to facilitate automated processes and data validation.
3. **Mobile Interface:** Design a user-friendly mobile interface for volunteers to input data.
4. **Limited Access Control:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict data input to specified timeframes.
5. **Training and Support:** Provide training resources and support to ensure easy adoption by volunteers.
